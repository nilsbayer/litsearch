       "  ' The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efﬁcient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters',\n",
       "  ' The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients',\n",
       "  ' The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpre- tations and typically require little tuning',\n",
       "  ' Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed',\n",
       "  ' We also analyze the theoretical con- vergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the conver- gence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework',\n",
       "  ' Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods',\n",

       "  '   It would appear logical to many that if a person has an illnes s that causes them discomfort,  pain, or even the long-term risk of serious harm or death that they would engage in treatment',\n",
       "  '  But we know that adherence to treatment is not guaranteed, and that approximately half of  patients do not take their medication as prescribed  [1] ',\n",
       "  ' Pati ent adherence in the real world  relates to a person’s ability to undertake their treatment prog ramme in a way in which they  have agreed with their healthcare professional (HCP), and hopef ully, in a way which we know  from clinical trials can produce a benefit',\n",
       "  ' Importantly, we kno w that these benefits are greatly  reduced or nullified in usual clinical practice when adherence rates are low  [2] ',\n",
       "  ' Clearly, if the  benefits of medications that we see in the carefully controlled  and monitored setting of clinical  trials are to be translated into real-world effects, low patien t adherence is a significant hurdle  for HCPs to overcome  [2] ',\n",
       "  '   Beyond maximising treatment benefits to individual patients, there is also a wider issue  to be considered that is now fundamental to healthcare systems worldwide, that of escalating  costs in the face of increasing demand  [3] ',\n",
       "  ' Patient non-adher ence can propagate a downward  spiral, with the poor outcomes resulting from not taking medica tion increasing the need for  further intervention by the healthcare service and thus escalat ing the ongoing costs',\n",

       "  '   What Factors Influence Patient Adherence',\n",
       "  '   In a recent Cochrane Database review of interventions for the enhancement of adherence,  only 17 of 182 studies included were considered to have a low r isk of bias in their design, and  thus reviewed in detail',\n",
       "  ' Most importantly, the specific charact eristics and effects of interven- tions identified as improving adherence varied among these stud ies and the authors were not  certain how consistent improvements could be achieved so that t he full health benefits of  medicines can be realised  [2] ',\n",
       "  ' Importantly, almost all of the  interventions judged to be  effective for long-term care were complex',\n",
       "  ' However, even the mo st effective interventions  did not produce large improvements in adherence and treatment o utcomes  [2] ',\n",
       "  '   The reasons that patients do not adhere to their treatment ar e multifaceted, results from  different studies are often conflicting  [4] , and there is a c omplicated interplay between  contributing factors',\n",
       "  ' These factors can be grouped as patient-r elated, provider-related, and  external ( Fig',\n",
       "  ' 1 )  [3, 5] ',\n",
       "  '    Research into adherence has usually focused on common barrier s patients face in taking  their medication, as many of these are viewed as under a patien t’s control and therefore  modifiable, but success has been mixed  [4] ',\n",
